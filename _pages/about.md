I am a PhD student at the Mechanobiology Institute. I am a pursuing an interdisciplinary program where I specialize in computer vision, statistics and genomics. <br/>

My research focuses on deciphering the contribution of mechanics to the variability observed in important heterogenous processes such as cancer biology and stem cell engineering. In my studies, I use combination of image and sequencing data at the single cell level to infer causality. <br/>

I am also interested in building quantitative 3D models of structures. Towards that end, I have developed computer vision algorithms quatitatify structures in 3D images. <br/>

I am excited about developing quantitative models that are descriptive and predictive of highly variable processes.
