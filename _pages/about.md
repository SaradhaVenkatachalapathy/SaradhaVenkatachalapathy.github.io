# About me
I am a PhD student at the [Mechanobiology Institute](https://mbi.nus.edu.sg/mechanisms/saradha-venkatachalapathy/). I am a pursuing an interdisciplinary program where I specialize in computer vision, statistics and genomics. <br/>

My research focuses on deciphering the contribution of mechanics to the variability observed in important heterogenous processes such as cancer biology and stem cell engineering. In my studies, I use combination of image and sequencing data at the single cell level to infer causality. <br/>

I also work twoards 3D models of structures. Towards that end, I have developed computer vision algorithms that quantify spatial informations from 3D images. <br/>

I am excited about developing quantitative models that are descriptive and predictive of highly variable processes.
