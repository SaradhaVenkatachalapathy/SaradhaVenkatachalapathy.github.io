My research focuses on deciphering the contribution of mechanics to the variability observed in important heterogenous processes such as cancer biology and stem cell engineering. In my studies, I use combination of image and sequencing data to infer causality. <br/><br/>

I am also interested in building quantitative 3D models of structures. Towards that end, I have developed computer vision algorithms quatitatify structures in 3D images. <br/><br/>

I am excited about developing quantitative models that are descriptive and predictive of highly variable processes.
