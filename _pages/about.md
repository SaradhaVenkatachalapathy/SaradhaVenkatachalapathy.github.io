# About me

I am a PhD student at the [Mechanobiology Institute](https://mbi.nus.edu.sg/mechanisms/saradha-venkatachalapathy/). I am pursuing an interdisciplinary program where I specialize in microscopy, computer vision, statistics and genomics. <br/>

My current research focuses on deciphering the contribution of mechanics to the variability observed in important heterogenous processes such as cancer biology and stem cell engineering. In my studies, I use a combination of image and sequencing data at the single cell resolution to infer causality. <br/>

Here is my [academic CV](https://SaradhaVenkatachalapathy.github.io/files/Saradha_CV.pdf) or for a quick read, here is my [resume](https://SaradhaVenkatachalapathy.github.io/files/Saradha_resume.pdf)
