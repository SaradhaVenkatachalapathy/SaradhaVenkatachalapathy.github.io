## Abstract
The collective activity of several molecular motors and other active processes generate large forces for directional motion within the cell, which is vital for a multitude of cellular functions such as migration, division, contraction, transport, and positioning of various organelles. These processes also generate a background of fluctuating forces, which influence intracellular dynamics and thereby create unique biophysical signatures, which are altered in many diseases. In this study, we have used the nucleus as a probe particle to understand the microrheological properties of altered intracellular environments by using micropatterning to confine cells in two structurally and functionally extreme geometries. We find that nuclear positional dynamics is sensitive to the cytoskeletal organization by studying the effect of actin polymerization and nuclear rigidity on the diffusive behavior of the nucleus. Taken together, our results suggest that mapping nuclear positional dynamics provides important insights into biophysical properties of the active cytoplasmic medium. These biophysical signatures have the potential to be used as an ultrasensitive single-cell assay for early disease diagnostics.
