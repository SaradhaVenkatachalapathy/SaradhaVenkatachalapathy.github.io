## Abstract
Cells in tissues undergo transdifferentiation programs when stimulated by specific mechanical and biochemical signals. While seminal studies have demonstrated that exogenous biochemical factors can reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, the critical roles played by mechanical signals in such reprogramming process have not been well documented. In this paper, we show that laterally confined growth of fibroblasts on micropatterned substrates induces nuclear reprogramming with high efficiency in the absence of any exogenous reprogramming factors. We provide compelling evidence on the induction of stem cell-like properties using alkaline phosphatase assays and expression of pluripotent markers. Early onset of reprogramming was accompanied with enhanced nuclear dynamics and changes in chromosome intermingling degrees, potentially facilitating rewiring of the genome. Time-lapse analysis of promoter occupancy by immunoprecipitation of H3K9Ac chromatin fragments revealed that epithelial, proliferative, and reprogramming gene promoters were progressively acetylated, while mesenchymal promoters were deacetylated by 10 days. Consistently, RNA sequencing analysis showed a systematic progression from mesenchymal to stem cell transcriptome, highlighting pathways involving mechanisms underlying nuclear reprogramming. We then demonstrated that these mechanically reprogrammed cells could be maintained as stem cells and can be redifferentiated into multiple lineages with high efficiency. Importantly, we also demonstrate the induction of cancer stemness properties in MCF7 cells grown in such laterally confined conditions. Collectively, our results highlight an important generic property of somatic cells that, when grown in laterally confined conditions, acquire stemness. Such mechanical reprogramming of somatic cells demonstrated here has important implications in tissue regeneration and disease models.
