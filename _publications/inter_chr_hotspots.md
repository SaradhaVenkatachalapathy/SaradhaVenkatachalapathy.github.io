## Abstract
The 3D structure of the genome plays a key role in regulatory control of the cell. Experimental methods such as high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) have been developed to probe the 3D structure of the genome. However, it remains a challenge to deduce from these data chromosome regions that are colocalized and coregulated. Here, we present an integrative approach that leverages 1D functional genomic features (e.g., epigenetic marks) with 3D interactions from Hi-C data to identify functional interchromosomal interactions. We construct a weighted network with 250-kb genomic regions as nodes and Hi-C interactions as edges, where the edge weights are given by the correlation between 1D genomic features. Individual interacting clusters are determined using weighted correlation clustering on the network. We show that intermingling regions generally fall into either active or inactive clusters based on the enrichment for RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and H3K9me3, respectively. We show that active clusters are hotspots for transcription factor binding sites. We also validate our predictions experimentally by 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments and show that active RNAPII is enriched in predicted active clusters. Our method provides a general quantitative framework that couples 1D genomic features with 3D interactions from Hi-C to probe the guiding principles that link the spatial organization of the genome with regulatory control.
