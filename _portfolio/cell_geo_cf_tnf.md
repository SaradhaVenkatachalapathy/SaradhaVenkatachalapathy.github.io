Cells in tissues integrate a multitude of mechanical and chemical stimuli from their microenvironment to modulate gene expression patterns and thereby, cell behavior. Most studies have been done on a population cells with heterogeneous cell geometries with the assumption that population means are descriptive of cellular phenomena.<br/><br/>
In our studies, fibroblast cells grown on rectangular and circular fibronectin coated micropatterns were exposed to the inflammatory cytokine TNFÎ± and compressive force (CF). When we measured the transcriptional response of cells in these conditions we found that there is geometry dependent expression. In addition, we show that such geometry specificity is exhibited by target genes of relevant transcription factors. <br/><br/>
Collectively, these results suggest the presence of an additional layer of transcription regulation that is driven by cell geometry.<br/><br/>
